0x08. C - Static libraries
Low-level programming & Algorithm â€• Hatching out

by Julien Barbier, co-founder at Holberton School

weight: 1

Ongoing project - started 06-03-2017, must end by 06-06-2017 (in 2 days)
Manual QA review must be done (request it when you are done on the project)

NOTE: this directory contains files related to 0x08. C - Static libraries.
In the static library libholberton.a, there may be some discrepancy between
the function in0x04 called
void _putschar(char *str)
which may be
void _putschar(char *s)
elsewhere.
Also, the function
int atoi(char *s)
is not completed (in 0x04) as it was an advanced project
but the file is created with the prototype
and it is also in holberton.h
